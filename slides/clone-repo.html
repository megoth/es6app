<h1>Cloning the skeleton repository</h1><p>Now that we have all our tools available, navigate to where you want to put your repository, and run:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/megoth/jsframework-skeleton
</code></pre><p>This downloads all the files necessary for this workshop (most of them are empty; we&#39;ll write them as we go though this presentation).</p>
<p>Next, navigate to the project and run:</p>
<pre><code>npm install
jspm install
</code></pre><p>The former installs all NPM-dependencies used for backend development, while the latter installs all jspm-dependencies used for front-end development.</p>
<p>With all of this setup done, we can now run our application by running the default Grunt task:</p>
<pre><code>grunt
</code></pre><p>This makes the application available at <a href="http://localhost:8282/">localhost:8282</a>. As it doesn&#39;t do anything yet, opening the page will be a sad sight... let&#39;s do something about that!</p>
