<h1>Setting up repository</h1><p>Now that we have all our tools available, navigate to where you want to put your repository, and run:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/megoth/jsframework-skeleton
cd jsframework-skeleton
</code></pre><p>You&#39;re now in the project. Next, run:</p>
<pre><code>npm install
jspm install
</code></pre><p>This install all the dependencies that the application have. Now we can run our application:</p>
