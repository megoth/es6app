We'll use a clone of [megoth/jsframework-skeleton](https://github.com/megoth/jsframework-skeleton) as base for the application. For this we need use [Git](http://git-scm.com/).

Install Git by finding the appropriate release [here](http://git-scm.com/downloads). This will install ```git``` as a command in your terminal.

Next, open your terminal, navigate to where you want to put your repository, and run:

    git clone https://github.com/megoth/jsframework-skeleton
    cd jsframework-skeleton
