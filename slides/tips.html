<h1>Some tips before we start</h1><p>As we will work with files that are loaded asynchronously, I highly recommend disabling the cache of your browser:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chrome: Open Developer Tools, open the Network-tab, enable &quot;Disable cache&quot;.</li>
<li>Firefox: Open Toolbox, open Toolbox Options, enable &quot;Disable cache (when toolbox is open)&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to have the Developer Tools/Toolbox open throughout the coding.</p>
