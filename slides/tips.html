<h1>Some tips before we start</h1><p>A couple of notes before we start.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-presentation">On the presentation</h2>
<p>I&#39;ll go through the slides with everyone, but if you think you can do it faster, please feel free to skip ahead. I&#39;ll make sure that everyone gets help, and in case it takes along time I&#39;ve written this slides for consumption by reading in mind. (I&#39;ll <em>not</em> just read the slides throughout the presentation.)</p>
<p>If you need help during the presentation, use the help-queue functionality. My helpers will help you when they are available.</p>
<h2 id="on-refreshing-the-cache">On refreshing the cache</h2>
<p>As we will work with files that are loaded asynchronously, I highly recommend disabling the cache of your browser:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chrome: Open Developer Tools, open the Network-tab, enable &quot;Disable cache&quot;.</li>
<li>Firefox: Open Toolbox, open Toolbox Options, enable &quot;Disable cache (when toolbox is open)&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to have the Developer Tools/Toolbox open throughout the coding.</p>
