A couple of notes before we start.

## On the presentation

I'll go through the slides with everyone, but if you think you can do it faster, please feel free to skip ahead. I'll make sure that everyone gets help, and in case it takes along time I've written this slides for consumption by reading in mind. (I'll _not_ just read the slides throughout the presentation.)

If you need help during the presentation, use the help-queue functionality. My helpers will help you when they are available.

## On refreshing the cache

As we will work with files that are loaded asynchronously, I highly recommend disabling the cache of your browser:

* Chrome: Open Developer Tools, open the Network-tab, enable "Disable cache".
* Firefox: Open Toolbox, open Toolbox Options, enable "Disable cache (when toolbox is open)".

Remember to have the Developer Tools/Toolbox open throughout the coding.
