As we will work with files that are loaded asynchronously, I highly recommend disabling the cache of your browser:

* Chrome: Open Developer Tools, open the Network-tab, enable "Disable cache".
* Firefox: Open Toolbox, open Toolbox Options, enable "Disable cache (when toolbox is open)".

Remember to have the Developer Tools/Toolbox open throughout the coding.
