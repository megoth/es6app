short: Install (Grunt)

[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) allows us to easily automate tasks for building and setting up our development environment.

We're going to use Grunt in our application to run our servers. (It also is used to generate the underlying material used, but we'll go through that in the bonus slides.)

Install it by running:

    npm install -g grunt-cli

It should now be globally available in your terminal.
